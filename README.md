# Astro + PhotoSwipe

[Sample page](https://astro-photoswipe.petrovicz.com/)

This is my way of adding PhotoSwipe to Astro, while using Astro's built-in image optimization features.
If you are trying to add PhotoSwipe to an existing Astro project, read my [blog post](https://dev.to/petrovicz/astro-photoswipe-549a).

If you are using ViewTransitions, please check out the `viewtransitions` branch.

You think you have a better solution? Feel free to roast me by opening an issue on this repo!

We are all human and prone to mistakes.
